# Glossary


## Develop
The web application and this readme are based on the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) project template at <https://github.com/sveltejs/template>.

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*

Install the dependencies...

    cd svelte-app
    npm install

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

    npm run dev

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

### Build and run in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

    npm run build

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. Or just open `public/index.html`.

### Deploy

The master branch is automatically deployed in a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/DigitaleZukunft/glossar/blob/master/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml) to the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/DigitaleZukunft/glossar/tree/gh-pages), which is served at <https://digitalezukunft.github.io/glossar/>.
